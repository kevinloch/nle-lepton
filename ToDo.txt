To Do:
 - Add support for subtracting reference mass ratios inside 1-minus term: (1-rmr-smr)
 - Improve speed of phase 1 and phase 2 for difficult formulas (generally those with sequential high inverse exponents like E+24+25+26)
 - Support for four term formulas without constant term (one zero mass root and three real positive mass roots)
 - Support for some limited rational exponents (2/x, 3/x, etc.)
