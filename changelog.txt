4.2  - Fixed several logic bugs in interesting() that were causing many factors to not be found
     - Fixed bug in verifyMatches() that was generating incorrect formula hashes and allowing duplicate formulas
     - Complexity score now ignores 1's in rationals for better selection of simplest duplicate formula
     - Added support for two additional user-supplied factors for outside radical for total of three
     - Added support for (1-smr) mode on term1 of 2-term formulas.  Enable by setting smrfactor_1minus_enable=yes and nle_mode=2.  Negative exponents
         are disabled in this mode, term1 must have an odd exponent, and both terms will use the same smr including reference mass.
         The Higgs vacuum expection value 'v' is the only currently supported reference mass in (1-smr) mode.
     - in (1-smr) mode it is possible to have unsolveable phase 1 formulas depending on the tested smrfactor and if it generates a minus term for at
         least one but not all solution masses.  Dynamic range and unsolvable tests are done in this mode.
     - Added phase1_random_samples_enable option.  When set to "no" variables are all set to center of experimental range each time phase1 is run
     - Phase 1 core functions are now using long doubles (80-bit extended precision on x86)
     - Phase 1 now solves to <= 1.0E-16 precision
     - Symmetry score is now computed only in verifyMatches(), it is then stored in nle_state->current_symmetry for use in phase 2 output
     - Symmetry score now has more checks

4.1  - Fixed bug in selectOutputs() that would not allow user-defined mass to be used as output
     - Fixed bug in generateExponents() that affected term3 when exp_neg_enable=no
     - Fixed bug in http results upload that would filter some results even when phase2_results_always=yes
     - Updated default Higgs boson reference value to 125.35 +/- 0.15 GeV published by CMS collaboration 
         https://cds.cern.ch/record/2691211/files/HIG-19-004-pas.pdf
     - term_id is now used as key in match tables instead of exp_inv
     - Initial development support for 2-term mixed (squared) mode, where a third term is generated synthetically from two base terms.
  
4.0  - First version to use an external configuration file (nle-lepton.cfg) to set search parameters
     - See nle-lepton.cfg for complete list of supported options
     - New types nle_config_t and nle_state_t greatly simplify arguments passed between functions

3.41 - Renamed project from polylepton to nle-lepton (nle = non-linear equation) since we are not working with true polynomials and
       to avoid confusion with multi-lepton decay processes
     - Renamed 'poly' string variable to 'exponents', changed other occurrances of poly or polyform to NLE, exponents or other appropriate words
     - Split monolithic source file into multiple files and added a basic Makefile
     - Renamed ALWAYSSHOWRESULTS compile time option to ALWAYS_SHOW_RESULTS

3.40 - Added ALWAYSSHOWRESULTS compile time option
     - Added consistency check requiring all three terms to have the same type of n-ball volume or n-sphere surface area factors
     - Now displays formula key in results output (L-M+R-1=0) along with term label (L,M,R) for each term formula
     - Increased support range of phase 1 filter to [3..6]
     - Support in phase 2 for solving for any variable including me and alpha
     - tmpmatchcomplexity is now calculated correctly in verifyMatches()

3.39 - Expanded supported dimensions from 12 to 26
     - Removed a^9 factor from M/mp mass ratio (this arbitrary scaling factor is not needed with higher dimensions)
     - Removed sqrt(2) factor from M/v mass ratio, as sqrt(2) inside radical is already included in initMultiplierArray()
     - Significant changes to phase 1  and phase 2 algorythims to be faster and more reliable
     - Phase 1 now uses electron mass as a temporary reference mass, actual reference masses are now introduced in cscanner()
     - Phase 1 and 2 now always solves all polyforms. Low dimension and mixed dimension polyforms are solved quickly.  Polyforms
       with sequential dimensions and especially higher sequential dimensions can take a long time to solve (over an hour in some cases).
     - Renamed project from 'lepton' to 'polylepton'

3.38 - Minor changes to phase 1 algorithm solvePolyForCoefficients() improves the solving difficult polyforms (like P+10+11+12)
     - Phase 2 solvePolyforMasses() now uses long double instead of double floating point
     - Phase 2 samplelimit increased (allows more phase 2's to be solved but slows the ones that fail to solve)
     - Compile time option IGNORE_SMALL_UNCERTAINTIES fixes alpha_em and electron mass to exact values for up to 4x phase 2 speedup
     - Version variable is now char[20] instead of float
     - Phase 1 output now part of "status" output instead of "search"
     - Cosmetic changes to some debug output

3.37 - first GitHub release
